# Capstone Project 1: HTML Resume  This is my first capstone project from Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp. The goal was to build a simple resume webpage using ONLY HTML.  ## What I learned: - Basic HTML structure - Semantic tags - Lists, links, images - Clean code formatting  This is the first stepping stone in my full stack journey!
